IDEAS:

  --- script(s) -> script loader ---
  Status: added.
  -

  removed functions from index.html and put them into seperate files: loaderOptions.js,Export.js,EventListeners.js, & CodeSaverLoader.js
  made script loader that loads loaderOptions.js,Export.js,EventListeners.js, & CodeSaverLoader.js
  and then undid all of it ^ :| 
  changed script loader from handling all scripts to just loading the monaco editor <script>
  moved Options,Export,EventListeners,CodeSaverLoader to index.html so you only need to get monaco
