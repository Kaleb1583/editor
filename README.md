# Monaco HTML Editor

This is a HTML editor/playground thats uses Monaco (Visual Studio Code Editor)

If you're on windows:
  I would use one of these: visual studio code desktop, vscode.dev, or another editor,
  Or you can use this but this may not as good as some alternatives.

If you're on chromium (intended os):
  You can use this if you want to code a website (since vscode.dev has no output)

Note: vscode.dev is the best vsc in the browser but is missing the feature to run code

### How to use editor:
 [kaleb1583.github.io/editor/](https://kaleb1583.github.io/editor/)

Or:

Clone repo with cmd: <kbd>git clone https://github.com/kaleb1583/editor</kbd>
Or download the [zip](https://github.com/Kaleb1583/editor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and then extract it to a folder and then open index.html)

### What you need:
  - index.html (monaco editor)
  - HTMLEditor.html (basic editor)
  - /assets/ (monaco editor code)

Note: share and export are similar but different features, share if for sharing code to others and export is downloading
