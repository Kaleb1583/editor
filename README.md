# Monaco HTML Editor
This is a HTML editor/playground that uses Monaco (Visual Studio editor)

If you're on Windows:
   I would suggest: Visual Studio Code desktop, VSCode.dev, or another editor
   Or you can use this but this may not be as good as some alternatives

If you're on Chromium (intended OS):
   You can use this if you want to code a website (since VSCode.dev has no output)

Note: VSCode.dev is the best VSC in the browser but is missing the feature to run code
