# Monaco HTML Editor

this is a html editor/playground thats uses monaco (visual studio editor)

if your on windows:
  i would use one of these: visual studio code desktop, vscode.dev, or another editor,
  Or you can use this but this may not as good as some alternatives.

if you on chromium (intended os):
  you can use this if you want to code a website (since vscode.dev has no output)

note: vscode.dev is the best vsc in the browser but is missing the feature to run code
