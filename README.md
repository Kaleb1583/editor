# Monaco HTML Editor

this is a html editor/playground thats uses monaco (visual studio editor)

if your on windows
  i would something like: visual studio code desktop, vscode.dev, or another editor
  or you can use this but this may not as good as some alternatives

if you on chromium (intended os)
  you can use this if you want to code a website (since vscode.dev has no output)

note: vscode.dev is the best vsc in the browser but is missing the feature to run code
