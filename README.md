# Monaco HTML Editor

This is a HTML editor/playground thats uses Monaco (Visual Studio Code Editor)

If you're on windows:
  I would use one of these: visual studio code desktop, vscode.dev, or another editor,
  Or you can use this but this may not as good as some alternatives.

If you're on chromium (intended os):
  You can use this if you want to code a website (since vscode.dev has no output)

Note: vscode.dev is the best vsc in the browser but is missing the feature to run code

### How to use editor:
