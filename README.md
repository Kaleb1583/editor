# Monaco HTML Editor

this is a html editor/playground thats uses monaco (visual studio editor)

if your on windows
  i would something like: visual studio code desktop, vscode.dev, or another editor
  or you can use this but this may not as good as some alternatives

if you on chromium (intended os)
  you can use this if you want to code a website (since vscode.dev has no output)

it may not work! it works locally for me but may not work when forking but kaleb1583.github.io/editor/ seems to be working.

note: vscode.dev is the best vsc in the browser but is missing the feature to run code

### How to use:

clone repo with cmd: git clone https://github.com/kaleb1583/editor
(or download the [zip](https://github.com/Kaleb1583/editor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and then extract it to a folder then open index.html)

What you need:
  index.html (monaco editor)
  HTMLEditor.html (basic editor)
  /assets/ (monaco editor code)

kaleb1583.github.io/editor/ status: working.
